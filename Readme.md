# Sitecore.Speak.Guidance #

The SPEAK Guidance Repository provides concise guidelines, conventions, and best practices related to implementing components and applications in SPEAK.  

*The SPEAK Guidance Repository replaces the Sitecore.Speak.Guideline repository.*

This repository describes *what* to do, not *how* to do it.  Please refer to the [Sitecore Doc Site](https://doc.sitecore.net/products/speak) for information regarding how to perform tasks in SPEAK. 

## How to use this repository

The repository organization helps you find the information most relevant to you based on your main activity, presuming that you currently focus mainly on either implementing an application using existing components, or implementing one or more components.

We recommend that you read ALL guidelines related your primary task, and you may safely ignore guidelines that do not related to your work.

### We welcome your input! 

If you have suggestions for how to improve these guidelines, or existing SPEAK components, please read the [Contributing to SPEAK](./Contributing%20to%20SPEAK/ProposingGuidance.md) guidelines.
